# 0.30.0

- Enhancement: Support plugins

# 0.29.1

- Fix: npmignore

# 0.29.0

- Build: Add yarn
- npm: Remove babel-env
- npm: Update dev deps

# 0.28.0

- Breaking change: Don't throw if encountering `Node.nodeType` as `undefined`;
    temporarily treat as `Node.ATTRIBUTE_NODE` for jsdom
- Breaking change: Remove an unused IE Shiv polyfill from `tests` directory
- npm: Add `browser` to `package.json` (and change `main` to point to
    Node-specific file)
- npm: Remove unused dependencies; add Rollup ones
- Build: Move Node code into separate entry file
- Build: Add Rollup code to potentially handle JSDOM as import (incomplete
    and may not work)
- Testing: Convert non-Nodeunit tests to Nodeunit and merge two test
    directories into one; simplify testing and leverage `setUp`; fix all broken
    tests; rename our assert code and have it accept a test object; make
    separate entry files for Node and browser; add test messages

# 0.27.0

- Fix: Actually add plugin apparently insisted on by Babel

# 0.26.0

- Fix: Add plugins apparently insisted on by Babel

# 0.25.0

- Fix: Add plugins apparently insisted on by babel-env

# 0.24.0

- Breaking change: Use `setAttribute` for `style` to ensure consistent
    serialization; could break if had been using to add styles to an
    existing element
- Breaking change (Browser): Remove most polyfills (no longer as concerned
    about old IE support, Babel or others can polyfill, and some are now
    better standardized, e.g., `XMLSerializer`)
- Breaking change (Node): Rather than always creating a new jsdom window,
    document (and XMLSerializer), look first for global ones (in case
    user wants to interact with same document object
- Breaking change (Node): Adjust and apply our own more browser-up-to-date
    `XMLSerializer` polyfill in place of `xmldom`.
- Enhancement: Allow for getting/setting of `window`, `document`, and
    `XMLSerializer` objects so we don't need to inject globals in Node.
- Fix: For Jamilih Maps, stop calling `super` on `this` (not needed
    and problematic in jsdom)
- Refactoring: Rollup and apply Babel to `jml-es6.js` to `jml.js`
    (ensuring older browsers and Node can support new features)
- Refactoring: Use new jsdom API
- npm: Add `module` property for sake of Rollup/Webpack
- npm: Update deps and devDeps
- npm: Add ESLint to test routines
- npm: Remove xmldom dep., add Rollup plugins for testing
- Testing: Add messages to tests, skipping some tests known to be not
    supported by jsdom
- Testing: Support one Node/browser polyglot testing, using Rollup
- Testing: Update tests to current browser expectations
- Docs: Document some newer features and other improvements

# 0.23.0

- For both files:
    - Breaking change: Support reasonable dynamic `template` creation
        (append to its `content` fragment instead of to `template` itself)
    - Allow document fragment to be appended as with elements

- For jml-es6.js file:
    - Breaking change: Change API for `jml.(Weak)Map.invoke` to pass element as first instead of last arg
    - Enhancement: Add `$shadow` for creating Shadow DOM
    - Enhancement: Add `$define` for Custom Element definitions
    - Enhancement: Add `$custom` for arbitrary addition of DOM properties/methods
    - Enhancement: Add `jml.command()` utility for invoking functions or
        methods attached to an element by symbol or map
    - Enhancement: Override `jml.Map` and `jml.WeakMap` `get` and `set` to accept selectors in
        place of elements; also allow in custom `invoke`

# 0.22.1

- Fix: For jml-es6.js file, avoid error if `opts.$map` doesn't exist!

# 0.22.0

- For jml-es6.js file, add `jml.sym` (and aliases `jml.symbol`
    and `jml.for`) utilities for retrieving a `Symbol` (or `Symbol.for`)
    instance on a particular element
- For jml-es6.js file, allow `$symbol` two-item array with the first
    item as a `Symbol` (or a string for `Symbol.for`) to be added as
    a key on the given element with the second item as the function
    or object to be its value. The object will have an `elem` property
    added to it to reference the current element, or, if a function
    is used, its `this` will be set to the element.
- For jml-es6.js file, allow `$data` attribute (and `$map` in config)
    (as yet undocumented)

# 0.21.0

- For jml-es6.js file, add `jml.weak`, `jml.strong`, `jml.Map`,
    and `jml.WeakMap` for easier association of elements to
    `Map` or `WeakMap` maps.

# 0.20.0

- For jml-es6.js file, `dataset` recursive objects fixed
    to always repeat prefix when other properties on same sub-object

# 0.19.0

- For jml-es6.js file, `dataset` recursive objects now support non-string
    primitive values (with null/undefined ignoring)

# 0.18.0

- For jml-es6.js file, support recursive objects under `dataset`.

# 0.17.0

- Refactoring: Add jml-es6.js file for ES6 module support
- Linting: ESLint ES6 module file and tests
- npm: Add ESLint script
- Testing: Serve proper content-types in test server
- Testing: Use ES6 modules in HTML tests and demo file
- Testing: Simplify suite running API

# 0.16.0

- Add `lang` to `NULLABLE` att group

# 0.15.0

- Add `pattern` to DOM properties
- Add new internal group `NON_NULL` for attributes that if set to `null`
    or `undefined`, they will not be set at all (useful for templates
    that can use the ternary operator to avoid setting)
- Add `max`, `min` to `NON_NULL` att group

# 0.14.0

- Avoid having nully dataset value set `dataset`, `class`/`className`,
    `style`, `for`/`htmlFor`, `innerHTML`, and `$on` handlers (as
    setting by DOM alone sets it to the string "undefined" or "null").

# 0.13.1

- Fix `readOnly` in map and bool check

# 0.13.0

- Add ATTR_MAP (inspired by JsonML): Only `readOnly`->`readonly` for now
- Add ATTR_DOM (inspired by JsonML): Attributes to be set in DOM along
    with booleans (Uses attributes in JsonML)
- Add 'disabled', 'readonly', 'indeterminate' to boolean attributes
- Refactoring: Define BOOL_ATTS (paralleling JsonML) for our boolean attributes
- Test refactoring (minor): Dummy favicon placeholders in test files for avoiding logs
- Test refactoring (minor): Switch from `GLOBAL` to `global` in tests

- Testing: All tests passing in Node, browser
- Testing: Upgrade tests per current DOM spec (no more `createEntityReference`) and `jsdom` behavior

- Testing: Temporarily provide workaround for `xmldom` in testing (non-namespaced serialization)
- Schema: Provided tentative JSON Schema

# 0.8.0
- Actual Node support
- Add document, document type, notation, entity, attribute node support
